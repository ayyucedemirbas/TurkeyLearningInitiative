Q1) (Pen&Paper) Simple forward and backpropagation.

Use your 7-digit student number as random seed. You need to show the actual results for forward and backward propagation. If numbers are too small or too big, calculate an approximate value by using 10^ notation. You can take the loss value as 1 to make backpropagation easier. Show every intermediate step. No need to update the input values. You can print the graphs and write the results on the nodes (x,y,z,q,f).
